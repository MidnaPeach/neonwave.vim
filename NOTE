Using the default 'light' works fine for this theme. Using 'dark' seems to f*ck up everything.
I know it's supposed to (I think), but I don't know exactly why.

That said, if -- for whatever reason -- you, the glorious user, decide to use background=dark,
then just stick it at the end of the highlight file. Who knows; maybe it will lead to inspiration for something else :3


Perhaps world domination...
